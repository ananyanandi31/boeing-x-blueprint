>> Made by Team Blueprint 

>> Sponsored by Boeing

Welcome to our Guide to Azure!

This holistic guide is designed to equip new graduates, early-career professionals, professors (their students), and self-learners to gain practical experience in building, automating, and deploying software and data workflows utilizing DevOps, DevSecOps in Azure, thereby bridging the knowledge gap in its principles and practices. 

## Module Components

## A. DevOps Module**

Content Overview:

1. **Introduction to DevOps:**

- Overview of DevOps principles and practices.
- Key tools: Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

- Using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Terraform.
- Automating the provisioning of resources.

3. **CI/CD Pipelines:**

- Setting up pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- Automating code builds, tests, and deployments.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**

- Setting up Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- Application performance and error tracking.

Hands-On Exercises:

- Build a pipeline to deploy a simple web application to Azure App Service.
- Automate testing and environment configuration using IaC.

## B. DevSecOps Module

Content Overview:

1. **Introduction to DevSecOps:**

- Principles of secure software development.
- Shifting security "left" in the software lifecycle.

2. **Security Tools Integration:**

- Implementing static code analysis with SonarQube or Snyk.
- Dynamic security scanning tools like OWASP ZAP.

3. **Securing CI/CD Pipelines:**

- Adding automated security tests to pipelines.
- Using Azure Security Center for compliance monitoring.

4. **Access Control and Secrets Management:**

- Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Managing secrets securely using Azure Key Vault.

Hands-On Exercises:

Add static and dynamic security scans to an existing CI/CD pipeline.
Set up Azure Key Vault to manage application secrets.

## Deliverables

1. **Plan with Milestone Schedule::**
- Prepare a project timeline with clear milestones to be approved by the project owner.

2. **Proposal (Presentation)::**
- Definitions of DevSecOps for software, DataOps for data products, CI/CD for applications vs data.
- Market Surveys of open job postings for required skills, showcasing user (student, professor, new graduates) interviews, university courses etc.
- Competitor analysis by conducting tool evaluation of open-source tools for creating CI/CD pipelines employing DevSecOps/DataOps principles.

3. **Procure & Build Lab in the Box:**
- Rewrite installation processes for DevSecOps tools (e.g., source code repositories, artifact management, build orchestration, security scanning) on Azure.
- Create samples and reference projects for users
- Document procedures for lab setup and teardown.

4. **Training Material:**
- Step-by-step exercises for the training module.

5. **Demo of Lab in the Box:**
- Present a working lab setup showcasing DevSecOps and DataOps pipelines.

6. **Implementation Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: User Research, Market Research and Industry standard tools research
- Week 3-4: Project Plan and Project Scope 
- Week 5-6: Proposal development
- Week 7-9: DevSecOps Module development
- Week 10-12: Training Material Finalization
- Week 13-15: Creating Hands-on exercises and reference applications
- Week 16-18: User Testing of Training Material
- Week 19-21: DataOps Pipeline development
